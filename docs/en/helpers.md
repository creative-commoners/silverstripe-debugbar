# Helper methods

## Quick debugging

The `d()` function helps you to quickly debug code. It will use the [Symfony VarDumper](https://github.com/symfony/var-dumper) to display the data in a "pretty" way.

In an XHR/AJAX context, it will simply display the data is a more simple fashion.

Called without arguments, it will display all objects in the debug backtrace. It will display the variable name before its content to make it easy to identify data amongst multiple values.

```php
d($myvar, $myothervar);
```

Any call to `d()` with "sql" in the name of the variable will output a properly formatted SQL query, for instance:

```php
d($myDataList->sql());
```

## Quick logging

The `l()` function helps you to log messages, and since they will appear in the "Messages" tab, it is very useful.

```php
l('My message');
```
