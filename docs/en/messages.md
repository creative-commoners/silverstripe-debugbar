# System logs and messages

The "Messages" tab will show you a list of anything that has been processed by `SS_Log` during a page execution:

You can filter the list by type by clicking on one of the log level buttons in the bottom right corner.

**Note:** At times, other DebugBar components may also send messages to this tab.
